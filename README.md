# 📊 Table Output & Processing

This work displays a dataset in its original format (Table 1) and calculates new values (Table 2) based on specific formulas. It is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is deployed on **Vercel**.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – Main web page to display both tables.
- `style.css` – Styling for layout and tables.
- `main.js` – Logic to populate Table 1 and compute Table 2.

## 🧮 Table 2 Computation

Values in **Table 2** are calculated from **Table 1** as follows:

| Category | Formula       | Computation |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Alpha    | A5 + A20      | 2 + 28 = 30 |
| Beta     | A15 / A7      | 80 / 5 = 16 |
| Charlie  | A13 × A12     | 90 × 3 = 270 |
